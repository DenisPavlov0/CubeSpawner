# CubeSpawner

<b>My task:

Spawn 400 cubes per square, size [20*20]. 
The cubes should spawn at 0.04 second intervals (this time should be configured via the inspector).
Add a “Change Colors” button, when clicked, the cubes will change their color one by one with an interval of 0.2 seconds 
(each cube should change its color within 0.5 seconds). The interval and time of the color change should be configurable via the inspector.
The color in which the cubes will be repainted by clicking on the button is randomly selected, one for all cubes.</b>
